### Hey there! 👋 I'm Collin Stasiak

I'm a full-time web developer and Tri-C graduate (go Triceratops!) with a strong background in building custom internal tools for a Security Operations Center (SOC). Over the past two years, I’ve developed and maintained production-grade applications with a focus on performance, security, and usability—helping analysts work faster, smarter, and safer.

### 🧠 What I Do

- 🔐 **Security-Focused Development**: I’ve spent the last 2 years working closely with SOC analysts, building tools to visualize threat data, automate reporting, and reduce manual overhead. Security-first coding practices are second nature to me.
- 🧰 **Tech Stack**: Daily driver of TypeScript, Angular, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I have been coding python since 12(check my commits if you don't believe me) but I fall back to js for my high level languages these days. I've been exploring Go for backend services.
- ⚙️ **Dev Tooling**: A passionate Vim user with a lovingly curated [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/gbc-collib/dotfiles) (check it out!). Obsessed with a clean, fast, and productive dev environment.
