### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-time web developer and a programming student at Tri-C. Here's a bit about me:

- Vim user BTW and very passionate about vim tooling! Explore my dotfiles repo for my setup.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on web projects using TypeScript, Angular, and Node.js.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning and currently diving into Rust, web assembly, and HTMX (very trendy I know)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborations, especially in the realm of web development.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to TypeScript, Angular, or Node.jsâ€”I love a good tech discussion.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm also exploring game development with Godot and honing my skills in pixel art to create a game completely from ground up.
